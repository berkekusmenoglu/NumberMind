# NumberMind

Number Mind is a logic-based game that involves guessing a secret
code consisting of a sequence of unique digits. The game is often
played with a sequence of four digits, but it can be played with
longer or shorter codes as well. The objective of the game is to
guess the secret code by making a series of guesses and receiving
feedback on each guess.
In each round of the game, the player makes a guess at the secret
code by entering a sequence of digits. The game then provides
feedback on the guess, indicating how many digits are in the
correct position and how many digits are correct but in the wrong
position. Using this feedback, the player can make subsequent
guesses that are more informed and closer to the correct code.
